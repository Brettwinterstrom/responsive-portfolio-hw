This project contains an About Me page, a portfolio page, and a contact me page. For all the pages I created a navbar which shrinks into a dropdown menu when the window is made smaller. The links within the navbar menu bring you to the other pages of the site. For the whole site I went for a simple them of dark and beige elements. In the contact page I added section where you can enter your email,name, and a message followed by a submit button. This elements also shrink and grow depending on window size. In the portfolio page there are image templates that also shrink to their own row when window is mad smaller. In the about me page youll find a picture of myself with some lorem Ipsum next to it. All the elements withing the container will shrink or grow depening on window size.
